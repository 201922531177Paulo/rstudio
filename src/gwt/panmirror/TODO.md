## TODO


- clicking the editor after find session doesn't update selection to click location

- scroll to selection

- may need a selectCurrent rather than selectNext so that we don't jump to the top.
- perhaps find should just hunt for decorations starting at the current selection

- sometimes a replace or a replace-all cannot be undone! (is it that we aren't getting the command?)

- sizing (width) for find/replace UI

- margin above footnote

- windows/linux deps/build
- initial article on using
- standard editor dialog boxes


## Enhancements

Improved treatment for relative image paths that don't resolve

Cursor location for insert yaml in the middle of paragraph

Provide some extra vertical space at the bottom when typing at the bottom

Should we consider scanning for heading links the way we scan for citations?
Or should we just get rid of input rules for heading links (and perhaps other 
links outside of plain links) entirely b/c the behavior is so hard to predict
and reason about (and this could be worse than no behavior at all)

Mark input rules should screen whether the mark is valid. Or do they even need to?
(i.e. the mark will be prevented)

improve scrolling with: https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll

multimarkdown support is incomplete:
   -mmd_title_block
   -mmd_link_attributes (not written, likely limitation of pandoc)
   -mmd_header_identifiers (work fine, but we currently allow edit of classes + keyvalue for markdown_mmd) 

no support for +pandoc_title_block

cmd+click for links (or gdocs style popup)

We currently can't round-trip reference links (as pandoc doesn't seem to write them, this is
not disimillar from the situation w/ inline footnotes so may be fine)

Improve EditorPane.showPandocWarnings treatment (including localization)

No editing support for fancy list auto-numbering (#. as list item that is auto-numbered)

EditorUI.translate call for translatable text

handling for div with only an id (shading treatment a bit much?)

internal links / external links via cmd+click

find/replace

  https://github.com/scrumpy/tiptap/blob/master/packages/tiptap-extensions/src/extensions/Search.js
  https://github.com/mattberkowitz/prosemirror-find-replace

Direct parsing of citations (get rid of special post-processing + supported nested)
 (note: for nested we need excludes: '')

## Project/Build

Can we minify the typescript library?

https://fuse-box.org/docs/getting-started/typescript-project

Can we combine the editor library w/ the prosemirror/orderedmap dependencies?

may need to make use of project references (allows mutliple tsconfig.json files
that all reference eachother)
   https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html
will ultimately need something like lerna:
